## ðŸ“‚ Projects

Check out my [Data Analysis Portfolio](https://github.com/fghlewis/Data-Analysis-Portfolio)

Iâ€™m mostly a self-taught Python developer, so my portfolio is structured more like an in-depth note-taking repository. Youâ€™ll find that all my code is thoroughly explained. I write it as if Iâ€™m teaching, which helps me better understand what Iâ€™m doing and document my thought process along the way.
